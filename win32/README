# Microsoft Visual C/C++ 2010 solution files

This directory contains projects and solution to build filemq as a static library.

Notes:
* Visual C/C++ somtimes randomly removes src files so you may have to readd it in the solution

Traps for the unwary contributor:
* To compile the C99 constructs in the ZFL codebase, you must use the /TP switch. You may not be able to build ZFL with older versions of MSVC, we've tested VisualStudio 2008.

* MSVC is much stricter about type conversions than gcc. Particularly when casting from void * to another pointer, explicit casts are necessary. Also for signed/unsigned character usage.
